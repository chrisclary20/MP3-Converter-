~~Tutorial: in the iframe (line 14-15), on line 14 add the url for the youtube video (youtube.com for short)
Example: src="https://yt-download.org/api/widget?url=" put the youtube video after url= 
==> src="https://yt-download.org/api/widget?url=youtube.com" <==~~

just host the html file locally and use the search bar, pizzazz

still glad I got that search bar working
